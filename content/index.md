# Typemill Dev

This development version of Typemill includes a **dev theme** and a **demo plugin**. It serves as a practical starting point for building and understanding themes and plugins.

The **Theme Guide** walks you through the structure of the dev theme. Each article corresponds to a file in the theme folder and includes explanations and examples.

The **Demo Plugin** demonstrates the basics of the plugin system. The guide is not ready yet.

For complete references, check the official documentation for [themes](https://docs.typemill.net/theme-developers) and [plugins](https://docs.typemill.net/plugin-developers).
