# home

The home folder contains some twig-templates that get included as section on the homepage. The templates are included in the `/pages/home.twig` template dynamically. Please read the description of that template first to understand the logic.

The home-folder is purely option, if you want to have a flexible and configurable landing page for your website. If your homepage is a normal content page, then you do not need this construct.
