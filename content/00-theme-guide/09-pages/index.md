# Pages

The `pages` folder contains Twig templates for different page types such as `folder`, `page`, `blog`, `post`, or `glossary`.

These templates are included in `index.twig` through conditional template logic. See the `index.twig` explanation to understand how this system works.

With this logic, you can also create custom templates that authors can select in the meta tab for each page. This allows for highly flexible layouts if needed.
