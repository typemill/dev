# Theme Guide

This guide follows the file and folder structure of the **dev theme**. It explains each folder and file with short descriptions and practical code examples. Use it as a reference while exploring the corresponding files in the theme directory.

The **dev theme** provides a tested and minimal foundation for building custom themes. Its structure and logic work well for different use cases such as simple websites, knowledge bases, or documentation portals. The guide also includes a "Markdown Test" page to ensure that all elements are properly styled in your theme.

Typemill themes are flexible. You can organize files and implement logic in your own way. To see different approaches, check other [Typemill themes](https://themes.typemill.net). For full references of available configurations, variables, and functions, see the official [documentation for theme developers](https://docs.typemill.net/theme-developers).
