# css-folder

The `css` folder includes the **Tachyons CSS library** and a `style.css` file. Both stylesheets are included in the `<head>` section of your `layout.twig`. 

You can replace Tachyons with any other CSS library.

## tachyons.min.css

[Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) is a small, functional CSS framework similar to Tailwind CSS, but it requires **no build step or preprocessing**. Just include the minified file, and you're ready to use utility classes in your HTML.

This works especially well with the **HTML plugin** for Typemill, allowing you to design content directly in the editor using utility classes.

If you prefer Tailwind, Bootstrap, or your own custom CSS framework, feel free to swap it in.

## style.css

This file contains **custom styles** for additional content formatting such as:

* Navigation
* Left- and right-aligned images
* Styled tables
* Notice or callout blocks
* Minor layout tweaks
* Print styles

These styles are suggestions and examples — feel free to modify or replace them to match your theme’s design.
